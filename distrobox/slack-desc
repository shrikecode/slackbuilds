# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

distrobox: Use any Linux distribution inside your terminal. Enable both backward
distrobox: and forward compatibility with software and freedom to use whatever
distrobox: distribution youâ€™re more comfortable with. Distrobox uses podman or
distrobox: docker to create containers using the Linux distribution of your
distrobox: choice. The created container will be tightly integrated with the
distrobox: host, allowing sharing of the HOME directory of the user, external
distrobox: storage, external USB devices and graphical apps (X11/Wayland),
distrobox: and audio.
