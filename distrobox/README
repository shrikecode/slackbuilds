Use any Linux distribution inside your terminal. Enable both backward and
forward compatibility with software and freedom to use whatever distribution
youâ€™re more comfortable with. Distrobox uses podman or docker to create
containers using the Linux distribution of your choice. The created container
will be tightly integrated with the host, allowing sharing of the HOME
directory of the user, external storage, external USB devices and graphical
apps (X11/Wayland), and audio.

For best results, use 'install-podman' script to install Podman locally.
This is why SlackBuild doesn't mention requirements like 'podman' or
docker.

To install podman locally follow these instructions:
