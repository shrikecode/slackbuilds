#+title: Additional SlackBuilds repository for Slackware

I made a clean start for my Slackware-current and / or 15.0.

SlackBuilds here will probably be quite lazy, binary tarball's repackaged if available.
I might submit some of them to official repository though, for now it is going to be my
private 'local override' for sbotools mirror kindof. Mainly because I need on more than
one machine, and see no reason of making it private.

** Usage

I will be only covering using it with sbotools. You can install it from [[https://slackbuilds.org/repository/15.0/system/sbotools/][SlackBuilds]].

It has no dependencies, so manual installation should be nice and easy.

Clone this repo to your computer, then run

#+begin_src sh
sboconfig -o /path/to/this/repo/copy
#+end_src

Now pick up some Slack!
