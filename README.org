#+title: Additional SlackBuilds repository for Slackware

* About this repository

I made a clean start for my Slackware-current and / or 15.0.

SlackBuilds here will probably be quite lazy, binary tarball's repackaged if available.
I might submit some of them to official repository though, for now it is going to be my
private 'local override' for sbotools mirror kindof. Mainly because I need on more than
one machine, and see no reason of making it private.
