Rant time: You've heard it before, git is powerful, but what good is that
power when everything is so damn hard to do? Interactive rebasing requires
you to edit a goddamn TODO file in your editor? Are you kidding me? To stage
part of a file you need to use a command line program to step through each
hunk and if a hunk can't be split down any further but contains code you
don't want to stage, you have to edit an arcane patch file by hand? Are
you KIDDING me?! Sometimes you get asked to stash your changes when switching
branches only to realise that after you switch and unstash that there weren't
even any conflicts and it would have been fine to just checkout the branch
directly? YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME!

If you're a mere mortal like me and you're tired of hearing how powerful
git is when in your daily life it's a powerful pain in your ass, lazygit
might be for you.
